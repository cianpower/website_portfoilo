                Snapchat is an app that is available on the app store (apple) and the google play store (android). It is a simple app. Once you download it and make an account it is amazing what you can do! You can send and receive videos and photos from your ‘friends’ once you have added them. You can also post to your ‘story’ which is something that all your friends can see. It is kind of like posting a status on Facebook or tweeting on Twitter. You can block certain people from seeing it. You can also make a ‘Private’ story which is one where you are in control of who you add to see the story. There are also public stories on snapchat and shows. From MTV to Beauty Insider, you can watch different mini shows or read articles. You can subscribe to certain mini shows or even news stories, so you never miss one! You can also chat to people without sending a video or picture, just like texting. There are also group-chats on the app in which you can have all your friends in one spot to text or snapchat.
