                Twitter is an application that you can download on any android or apple phone through the app/play store for free. Twitter is a social media platform that allows you to post messages known as “tweets”, it allows you to like posts by other users and retweet their posts on your own page. Twitter was founded in 2006 in San Francisco. On twitter you can use the hashtag key before a relevant word, this allows your tweets to be found easier by other users. By clicking on a hashtag in a tweet it brings you to any other tweets that also include that word or phrase. Twitters logo since 2010 is of a white bird on a light blue background. The bird is said to be the “twitter bird” and that’s why the posts are called “tweets”, as that is the sound the bird would make so it makes sense.

            <h3 class="regtitle"> The Set Up</h3>
            <p class="intro">1.Registering an account for twitter is very simple and
                easy that basically anybody at any age that’s old
                enough for the application can make an account
                All you need is either an email address or a phone
                number to get started.</p>

            <p class="intro">2.Once you type up twitter on google it will load you up
                to this page where you can either make an account or
                sign into an existing account, if the person already had
                an account they would head straight into twitter and
                wouldn’t see this page.</p>

            <p class="intro">3.When you press sign up you will be introduced to this
                page and you have created a username for your
                account and you also have to either put your email
                address down or your phone number
                The reason you have to do either one of them is
                because it will help twitter contact you just in case
                something happened to your account.</p>

            <p class="intro">4.Once you made your account you will be brought into
                this screen and depending on which option you picked
                they will send a code to your email or number and ask
                you to type it in just to make sure you’re not a bot or
                fake account.
            </p>

            <p class="intro"> 5.After that they will ask you to make a password it can be anything it just has to be at least 6 letters long.
            </p>

            <p class="intro">6.After all that is done twitter will ask you to select thing
                that you are interested in, this will help them find and
                help you choose on what and who to follow on twitter
                since it’s your first time on the app.</p>
