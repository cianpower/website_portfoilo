                Before even thinking about anything academic, TikTok has been a place where you could learn something new. These include the popular video topic “life hacks”. This is where a user explains a trick to use in everyday life to make a certain task or chore a little more manageable. Other things you could learn from Tik Tok also include cooking, fitness tips, and even how to do the most popular dance trends.

This is a form of eLearning where users can post videos to teach others about various different topics, ranging from fitness workouts to solving mathematical equations. As of its launch, the genre of videos has received over 48 billion views on the app.
