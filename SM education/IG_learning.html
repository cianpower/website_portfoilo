                Instagram is a social app that can be used for teaching and learning in Education. There are over 1 Billion users on instagram with 72% being teenagers. 35% of the teenagers in the US said that Instagram is their preferred social media platform. This just shows that instagram has a huge potential to be used in Education.
                One of the first things a teacher should do if wanting to use Instagram as an educational tool is to set up a private classroom account which every student can join and follow. Then following from that, here are a few examples of how Instagram can be used for the purpose of Education in a classroom:

            <img class="educationimage" src="Images/instagram_in_education.jpg">
            

        </div>


        <br>

        <div class="reg">


            <h3 class="regtitle">How its used</h3>
            <p class="intro"> Finding Ideas:
                A great way teachers can find new and interesting ideas to use in class would be to search around on Instagram, there are many teacher and educational accounts around that can be followed and provide great ideas. Following the hashtag #teachersofinstagram will help a teacher find those accounts easily.</p>

            <p class="intro">Capture Memories:
                A teacher can post pictures of a lot of the memories made in class. This can be from regular days in class, to going on a trip or completing cool activities. This can remind the students of these memories and also allow their parents to see all the interesting things their children are doing at school.</p>

            <p class="intro">
                Show Students Work:
                Instagram is a perfect place to showcase students' works and achievements, since it works on a basis of posting pictures with a caption underneath. The class account can act as a place to post award winning projects and achievements that the students have made.</p>

            <p class="intro"> Help Students:
                Teachers can use Instagram to help students by posting homework and reminders for projects. They can also post useful tutorials or links to useful sites that the students can use to learn. The comments section can also be used to engage the whole classroom and students can learn of one another that way too. The Direct Messages can also be useful when a student needs to ask a question relating to a post privately if they don't want to comment.</p>
